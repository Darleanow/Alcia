# Utility Scripts

Those scripts were used in large I/O operations that I was too busy to make, I'm keeping them because someone might need one of them maybe ?

`DISCLAIMER`: Those are (mostly) generated by ChatGPT as I don't really enjoy python coding, aswell those were to fix things, so nothing really important.

## convert_str_to_int.py

This script was used to convert all strings from my json to integers where applicable.
I dumbly made Health from Enemies.json initially a string.
To use it, just rename within the script the input/output file.

TODO(Enzo): Make this script useable with params xd.
